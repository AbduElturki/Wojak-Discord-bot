# Wojack Discord Bot
## What does it do?
The bot fetches an image from [Wojak meme collection at memeatlas](https://www.memeatlas.com/wojak-memes.html) and posts it to your discord server.

There are currently two commands:
+ `!wojak` posts a random wojak image.
+ `!wojak <Name>` where `<Name>` is wojak image name from prior mentioned collection. If the name doesn't match the script will try to find the closet name possible.

## Why did you make?
I got bored and it took no time.

## Requirements
You must have Discord.py and Python 3.7 to use this bot

```
pip install discord
```
You must also have a file named `DISCORD_TOKEN` that contains a bot token inside your local (cloned/forked) repo
